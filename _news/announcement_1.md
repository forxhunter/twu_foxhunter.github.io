We presented our latest research on **spatially resolved hybrid stochastic-deterministic modeling** of the galactose regulatory network in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* at the **Biophysical Society Annual Meeting 2025**. This work addresses a major challenge in systems biology: simulating whole-cell behavior in spatially heterogeneous environments.

Using the **hybrid reaction-diffusion master equation-ordinary differential equation (RDME-ODE)** methodology implemented in **Lattice Microbes**, we modeled the galactose regulatory network with its complex 3-layer feedback loops governing galactose uptake and metabolism. This regulatory network serves as a canonical model of gene regulation, exhibiting both **bistability and stochastic behavior**.

**Key Findings:**
- Exposure to **0.2% (11.1 mM)** external galactose concentration leads to significant intracellular galactose increase
- Parallel rise in transporter and reporter protein expression within **60 minutes**
- Results consistent with experimental data from Ramsey et al. (2006) and Acar et al. (2005)
- Exploration of varying external galactose levels and their impact on cellular decision-making

This work demonstrates the feasibility of **whole-cell modeling in eukaryotic systems** and highlights the critical role of **spatial heterogeneity** in cellular regulatory processes. The hybrid computational framework opens new possibilities for understanding complex biological systems at unprecedented resolution.
