We are excited to announce the publication of our preprint on **"Spatial Heterogeneity Alters the Dynamics of the Yeast Galactose Switch: Insights from 4D RDMEâ€“ODE Hybrid Simulations"** on bioRxiv. This work represents a significant advancement in whole-cell modeling of eukaryotic systems.

**Key Innovations:**

- **First 4D simulations** of the galactose switch in _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_
- **Hybrid framework** integrating reaction-diffusion master equations (RDMEs) with ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
- **GPU-based Lattice Microbes** platform enabling realistic whole-cell simulations
- **Cryo-electron tomogram (cryo-ET) derived cell geometry** for unprecedented spatial accuracy

**Major Findings:**

- **11 mM extracellular galactose** triggers expression of **10,000-15,000 galactose transporters** within **60 minutes**
- **Spatial differentiation** between cytosolic and ER-associated ribosomes enables realistic protein translation modeling
- **Multi-GPU performance benchmarking** across various spatial decompositions
- **Cellular geography** significantly impacts genetic information processing and protein production

**Technical Highlights:**

- Stochastic simulation of genetic information processes
- Deterministic modeling of simplified metabolism
- Explicit tracking of membrane-targeted proteins like galactose transporter Gal2
- Quantification of ER maze-like structure effects on protein delivery

This work demonstrates the feasibility of **whole-cell modeling in eukaryotic systems** and reveals how **spatial heterogeneity** fundamentally alters cellular decision-making processes. Our framework paves the way for more complex organism simulations and provides insights into the critical role of cellular architecture in genetic regulation.
